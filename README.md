# enjoy-the-outdoors


The goal of this project was to strengthen the knowledge on working with arrays and for loops. Using functions, if statements and for loops I was able to render cards that filtered when users selected their personal preference and also implemented bootstrap cards within the functions so that park and mountain information was visible to the user.

One piece of interesting code I wrote was using if else statements to  render my park type. prior to getting it to work, I used and (&&) or (||) to differentiate but the computer did'nt fully recognize it.
